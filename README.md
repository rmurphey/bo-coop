# Bo-Coop

A system for monitoring a chicken coop using
[johnny-five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five).

Much thanks to [Bocoup](http://bocoup.com) for the use of the name. If
you haven't heard of them, you should check them out -- not least because
they are one of the biggest backers of Johnny Five.
