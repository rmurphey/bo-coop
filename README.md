# Bo-Coop

A system for monitoring a chicken coop using
[johnny- five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five) on a set of Arduinos
connected to a Raspberry Pi.

Much thanks to [Bocoup](http://bocoup.com) for the use of the name. If you
haven't heard of them, you should check them out -- not only because they are
one of the biggest backers of Johnny Five, but also because they have a thing
for chickens.
